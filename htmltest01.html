    <h1>A formula to follow</h1>
    <p>
        Frameworks for dealing with worry can be helpful, 
        especially since worry destroys our ability to concentrate. Without being able to concentrate, 
        not only do we feel worse, but we’re less effective.

        If you have a situation where you’re worrying about failing, follow these three steps.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Step 1: Analyze a situation causing you worry to determine the worst possible scenario if you fail.
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 2: Accept the worst possible case scenario, if it is to happen.
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 3: Focus on trying to improve the situation so that you end up with a better outcome than worst case.
            </li>
        </ul>
            
        
    </div>

        <h2>Why you should care about worry</h2>

        “The greatest mistake physicians make is that they attempt to cure the body without attempting to cure the mind; yet the mind and body are one and should not be treated separately.” – Plato

        <br /><br /><br />

        Worry isn’t just something that makes you feel a little worse or makes it less likely that you can concentrate. It’s something that can lead to seriously adverse health effects for your mind, body, and soul. These negative effects can cause much worse situations with your health than whatever it is that you’re worrying about.

        In short, worry is not worth the physical toll it can take on your body.
